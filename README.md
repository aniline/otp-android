## One Time Password generator android app

Wrapped Harry Mantakos' (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~harry/jotp/) otp code in an android app.
Does not look good, but it gets the job done (not having to type your unix password
when someone is looking). I used to use it with a debian installation having libpam-opie.
I can't seem to find that pam module anymore in debian packages.
